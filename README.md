# Serverless URL Shortener
A lightweight URL shortener built with the Serverless Framework that uses AWS Lambda, S3 and API Gateway. Amazon S3 is used to host the public website and handle the URL forwarding.

## Setup
### Install dependencies
Head on over to the [Serverless Framework docs](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fserverless.com%2Fframework%2Fdocs%2Fproviders%2Faws%2Fguide%2Fquick-start%2F) and run through their quick-start guide. Itâ€™s mentioned in there as part of your setup, but be sure to install the AWS CLI and configure your AWS credentials. Then run `npm install` to get the NPM dependencies for the project.

### Add config
Create a copy of *config.sample.json* as *config.json* and then customise as appropriate for your setup.

Name | Description | Required
--- | --- | ---
BUCKET | The S3 bucket name to use. This will form part of the URL shortener website address if you're not using a custom domain. | Y
REGION | The [AWS region](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) to deploy to. | Y
STAGE | The [AWS stage](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-deploy-api.html) to deploy to. | Y
API_URL | The URL of the endpoint that forms should be sent to. This is only known after the first deployment, so leave empty for now. | Y

### Deploy API
Run `npm run deploy:serverless` to instantiate the necessary resources on AWS. This command will return an endpoint URL that you should add as *API_URL* in *config.json*.

### Deploy website
Run `npm run build && npm run deploy:static` to deploy the website using AWS CLI. The build run script simply sets the form action to *API_URL* from *config.json*.

## Libraries used
