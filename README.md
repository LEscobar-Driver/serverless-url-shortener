# Serverless URL Shortener

A lightweight URL shortener built with the Serverless Framework using AWS Lambda and S3. Each URL redirection is stored as an S3 object with the `Website-Redirect-Location` metadata key set to the forwarding web address. AWS Lambda is used to create an API to save these objects. The website is served from the same S3 bucket.

## Setup

### Install dependencies

Head on over to the [Serverless Framework docs](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fserverless.com%2Fframework%2Fdocs%2Fproviders%2Faws%2Fguide%2Fquick-start%2F) and run through their quick-start guide. Itâ€™s mentioned in there as part of your setup, but be sure to install the AWS CLI and configure your AWS credentials. Then run `npm install` to get the NPM dependencies for the project.

### Add environment variables

Create a copy of _.env.example_ for each "stage" (e.g. _.env.staging_, _.env.production_) and then customise as appropriate for your setup.

### Deploy API

Run `npm run deploy` to deploy the API and website to AWS. The resources defined in _serverless.yml_ will be automatically instantiated using CloudFormation.

Prefix the command with the stage you want to deploy (e.g. `STAGE=production npm run deploy`).

#### CloudFormation

All AWS resources are created automatically. Heavily borrowed from [serverless-aws-static-websites](https://github.com/tobilg/serverless-aws-static-websites).

### Build template

Run `npm run build` to set the form action on the website template to `API_URL` from _config.json_.

### Deploy website

Run `npm run deploy:client` to deploy the website using the AWS CLI.

_You can add a `?vanity=` query string parameter to the homepage to specify a vanity name instead of a randomly-generated one. If the name is taken, a random one will be used._
